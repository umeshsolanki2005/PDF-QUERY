# PDF-QUERY
This task involves developing a PDF query system using LangChain and Ollama to extract relevant information from documents based on user queries. The system loads and parses a UHV (Universal Human Values) PDF, extracts text using PyPDFLoader, and splits it into smaller chunks with RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for efficient retrieval. The extracted text is then embedded using HuggingFaceEmbeddings and stored in a FAISS vector database for quick search and retrieval. A RetrievalQA chain is implemented with Ollama's LLM (Llama 3.2) to interpret user queries and fetch relevant document sections. When queried about "basic human aspirations," the system successfully retrieved and generated a meaningful response based on the context. This approach enhances document understanding, efficient searching, and AI-driven knowledge retrieval, making it useful for research and automated document analysis.
